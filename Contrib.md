It is not the idea that succeeds or fails, but its execution.


Tin Feathers is a good idea. Its time is now. There is a vision -- admittedly limited --
of its aims and aspirations, immediate goals and brief glimpses of future possibilites.


Help is needed in so many areas: governance, financial, legal, IP, publicity, education...
The list has no end. It is fair to say that any skill you have will be needed. All your
knowledge and experience. The challenge is to gather and coordinate individuals
who believe sufficiently in the Tin Feather idea to act upon it.


The primary concern is how to ensure that this is, and will always be, a non-profit exercise?
How should it be structured to ensure that it can not be pre-empted, hijacked, or extorted?


There is a potential to generate funding here that is beyond my ability to manage.
There is certainly a need of funds. But no one must profit from it. The problems Tin Feathers
aims to address are best approached from outside the bounds of profit, capitalism, and
entrepeneurship. Those are necessary skills, but the goals are very different.
Yes, I have other enterprises from which I want to make a living, but not this one.



For financing, are Kickstarter, Patreon and their ilk appropriate? I don't see how corporate
sponsorship could do it, but I know nothing in such areas.

What are the appropriate means to secure the IP of the "Tin Feather": trade mark? copyright?
open source licensing?

Will Tin Feathers use the infrasturcture and products it opposes? Would it be banned from such?

How does an international, distributed, decentralized effort organize?


I do not know. But I know that there are open source teams that succesfully coordinate information
and resources across personal, coporate, and international barriers. I believe implicitly there are
indiduals out there who will believe in the Tin Feather cause that have such knowledge.


The immediate need is to bring such people together productively to make this happen.
