# TODO

* organization
    * create develop branch
    * directories
    * fix links; stick to develop for now

* This might all work better in a [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).

* How does one get 10s of thousands of little metal pins made?

* Investigte Kickstarter. How does it work? How does it stay honest?

* how to connect with others?

* website for wider public

* wise up -- too late for that.
