# Is this a book? let's see...

It does not need to be a publishable book as profit is not the motive. The
goal is to circulate the ideas. Consider self-publishing as a blog, web-site,
tiddly wiki, pdf, etc etc.

Therefore it is not constrained by the publishing industry rules or guidelines.
That said, non-fiction is around 100K words, narrative non-fiction can be as
short as 50-60K words. Would this work as latter? Dual thread... what is
outlined below interspresed with a diary of Tin Feather's progress as an public
exercise? Would this be readable? hold an audience?


## Introduction
* audience - programmers
* purpose
    * education
        * the existence of the problem
        * (bonus - some maths to make you a better prgrammer)
    * [mobilization](https://github.com/tin-feather/TinFeather/blob/develop/StatementOfPurpose.md#secondary-purpose)


## Part I

### Problems
* World faces many problems. Others have cataloged better.
* Programmers are not fully/valuably utilized in solving world's
problems. As yet untapped resource.
* While concentrating on one problem the aim is to provide a plan
that can be modified for tackling others.

### This problem
* surveillance capitalism and invasive data harvesting
* history
    * horse race predictions? - shows the value of a list of people
    * nose-hair clippers and x-ray glasses
    * Nigerian princes

* big data - how much they are gathering
* metadata analysis - how much they know from it
* problems arising from this
    * no such thing as secure data - oxymoron
    * machine learning biases
    * lack of transparency

### What can programmers contribute
* Programmers solve problems for a lving.
* Programmers understand this particular problem.
    * the type of problem - dynamic mess
    * what surveillance capitalism is doing
        * data gather and storage
        * machine learning etc
* (Programmers _cause_ many of the problems, too.)

> This transitions nicely from previous to next section. We
> understand because we have created these systems. And perhaps
> it is time for us to repent, to ask forgiveness.

* Programmers need to step up and help.

### Why now?
* corporate malefeasance - see appendix
    * incompetence
    * negligence
* governments won't/can't address the issue
* where will it lead - information dystopia
* Time is ripe; many feel this way - see appendix

* Taxation without Representation(?)



## Part II
assess tools at our disposal

### Tools we all know
* tools - bread and butter
    * Divide and Conquer
    * Composition
    * point out that this is Category Theory? (foreshadowing)
* techniques
    * domain driven development
    * agile
    * Basically, just having a rational, logical approach

### Some mathematics we should all know
* mathematically informed software engineering
* Linear vs non-linear
* Linear Algebra
    * orthogonality
    * projections -  TruthAndLinearAlgebrar
* Category Theory ?
    * Eugenia Cheng
    * Bartosz Milewski


## Part III
This section will analyse and apply these to the problem.

### How to have an effect
* leverage
* resonance
* unity

### Logical plan
* create consensus
* maintain consensus
* execute

### Modes of Failure
* disunity
* single point of failure
* mitigation of vulnerablities


## Part IV
Motivating prgrammers and herding cats.

### The psyche of the programmer.
* stereotypes
* negative
* positive
* both

### Why we don't act
* impostor syndrome
* analysis paralysis
    * due diligence
    * fear of mistake

### Action
* why we must
    * Emphasize that a programmer _has_ to follow a logical argument;
    * and will do so more thoroughly than most (non-programmer) people.
    * (This foreshadows the challenge of the book's conclusion.)

* Warnings before we do act
    * First, do no harm. [code of conduct](CodeOfConduct.md)
    * beware hubris
    * BEWARE HUBRIS!


## Part V
Now we come to the lab work

### Tin Feathers
* aims
    * jewelry
    * raise awareness
    * conversation for solution - open source
* show how it demonstrates all the ideas above
    * minimal scope
    * unassailable

### Proof of Concept
* Programmers are great at copying a known solution.
* suggest future - if this works, what can we not do!

### The gauntlet
* Conclude with the challenge - Step up


## Appendix
### Articles
### Others
* others feel the same
* quotes, etc
### Links
* people
* organizations
### Details of Tin Feathers
If book follows project
* Raising funds
* manufactuer
* distribution, publicity
* results (so far)?
