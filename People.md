# People

From where can we draw hope? From these individuals and organizations.

Consider this list a public service, a pointer to educational resources.
I solicit others to educate me by suggesting additions.


Would they wear the Tin Feather? How can they be asked politely, with
humility, without wasting their time? How can we reach them? Is it
really only six degrees of separation?

How on earth can we possibly demonstrate *bone fides*?



Consider this a page an open letter, an invitation, a nomination.

Consider it sincere thanks.
