It is not the idea that succeeds or fails, but its execution.


Tin Feathers is a good idea. Its time is now. There is a vision -- admittedly
limited -- of its aims and aspirations, immediate goals and brief glimpses of
future possibilites.


Help is needed in so many areas: governance, financial, legal, IP, publicity,
education...  The list has no end. It is fair to say that any skill you have
will be needed. All your knowledge and experience. The challenge is to gather
and coordinate individuals who believe sufficiently in the Tin Feather idea to
act upon it.


The primary concern is how to ensure that this is, and will always be, a
non-profit exercise? How should it be structured to ensure that it can not be
pre-empted, hijacked, or extorted? The problems Tin Feathers aims to address are
best approached from outside the bounds of profit, capitalism, and
entrepeneurship. Those are necessary skills, but the goals are very different.


How does an international, distributed, decentralized effort organize?


&iota; do not know. But there are open source teams that succesfully coordinate
information and resources across personal, coirporate, and international
boundaries. The immediate need is to bring such people together productively to
make this happen.
