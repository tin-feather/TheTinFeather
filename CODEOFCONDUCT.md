# Code of Conduct

Unfortunately, even a code of conduct can cause dissent. To keep it
simple, we shall adopt an ideal, if not the exact words, that has
stood the test of some two and half millennia:

    "First, do no harm."

That, common manners, and Tin Feather's orthogonal independence from
other issues should keep us in a civil and effective working order.
