# Two Principles

## Linearity
More than thirty years ago on a windy autumn day the breeze
attempted to make off with the trilby of a distinguished looking,
but not terribly fit old man. I recovered and returned said hat.
The short conversation we shared over the few following blocks
has stuck with me to this day as a strange, almost dream-like
memory.


That eccentric gentleman believed many of the problems in this
world are caused by the fact that most politicians do not
understand the difference between the adjectives __linear__
and __non-linear__. As he explained, it is really quite simple.
In a __linear__ phenomenon, a little bit is good and more is
better. Always, full stop. In a __non-linear__ phenomenon,
a little bit is good, more is better _up to a point_, but beyond
that, more is worse.


Nutrition illustrates. Lack of vitamin C causes
scurvy. Our bodies need vitamin C. A bit of it is good for us.
More of it does not hurt; excess is simply expelled in our urine.
Vitamin A is also a necessary nutrient; we need a bit of it. In
high doses, however, vitamin A is poisonous. Beyond a certain
point, it is toxic and can in fact kill.


I am encouraged to see this lesson repeated from many sources
since that windy day so many years ago. Thankfully, more and
more people are coming to understand the difference. Better
still, this broader understanding is itself a linear
phenomenon. The more people that understand it the better
off the world will be.


## Orthogonality

I have discovered a further mathematical concept whose lack of
understanding contributes greatly to the argument and strife
around us: __orthogonality__. Despite sounding more frighteningly
mathematical, this concept, like linearity, needs to be more
widely understood.


It too is quite simple. Othogonal properties can change
independently. When one goes up, the other may go up, go down, or
not change at all. Consider the x y plane of the page where we drew
graphs in our early math classes. Two numbers uniquely determine a
point relative the origin. From the origin, the point (3, 4) is
3 units over and 4 units up.

The perpendicular x-axis and y-axis are __orthogonal__. Our point
can slide side to side, changing its first coordinate (its x value)
and the second coordinate (the y value) remains unchanged. Likewise,
it can slide up and down, changing its second coordinate (its y
value) and the first coordinate (the x value) remains unchanged.
The x and the y axes change independently as the point moves side
to side and up and down.

What if now we slant the y-axis so that it is no longer perpendciular
to the x-axis, no longer vertical on our page? Two coordinates still
uniquely determine the location of our point relative the origin, but
consider what happens as the point moves.

If it slides side to side its first value, the x coordinate,
changes while the second, the y coordinate, stays the same just as
before. As the points slides up and down what happens? Its
y coordinate changes, but so does its x coordinate. That is
because these two axes are no longer __orthogonal__.

## So what?

What does this have to do with social conscience and reform?

To affect change in this large world requires large forces. Newton
showed us that. It applies in the world of social ideas as well as
in the physical world. Individually, we can exert only a small force
for change. In the abstract world of social ideas this may just be
over ourselves. To affect large scale change, therefore,  we must
pool our efforts and work together.


Disunity diffuses and defuses our power. The opposition sows disunity
by emphasizing the differences within our coalition. But we do not
need to be united on all those other issues. What difference does age
make when it comes to a protest over surveillance capitalism and invasive
data harvesting? What difference race or religion? THey are all __orthogonal__
to the Tin Feather, as they should be.


The only difference gender identiy or sexual preference could
possibly make within Tin Feathers is if you are using it as a means
to find a date or mate. If so, please, take it outside. Internally it is
only a
[vulnerability](https://github.com/tin-feather/TheTinFeather/blob/master/Vulnerability.md)
to be exploited by those that oppose our purpose.


The unidifed diversity.
