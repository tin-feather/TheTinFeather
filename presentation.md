# Presentation


The current state of the presentation of this material is woeful.
However, it is more important to capture these ideas when the Muse
offers them than it is to learn how to blog.

Is this:
* book
* wiki, tiddlywiki
* interactive non-fiction
* blog posts, diary
* lecture
* sermons, lessons, rants
* chaiutauqua - Robert Pirsig
* pamphlet - invoking founding fathers
