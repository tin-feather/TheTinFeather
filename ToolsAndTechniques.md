# Tools and Techniques

How to proceed? More than 30 years of professional work in the
software industry has shown me success and failure in tackling
large, ill-defined problems. Today's world contains an abundance
of such problems, surveillance capitalism and invasive data
harvesting only one among many. Our industry, though young, has
discovered and honed many tools and techniques to deal with such
issues. Timn Feathers aims to apply these to find a way forward,
a way to nurture this nascent social conscience I find in myself.


# Mathematically informed software engineering

I am not a practicing mathematician; while my heart lies in
mathematics, I do not prove theorems for a living. Furthermore,
throughout my career I have seen many programmers more capable
than I. I do, however, understand more mathematics than most
programmers I meet and find I am a better programmer than most
mathematicians I run across. Tin Feathers, then, is a public
experiment in the application of mathematically informed software
engineering principles to larger problems of social engineering.


The problem is to mobilize the wasted talents and energies of
the information technology community to achieve a modest social
goal, thereby providing a proof of consept of how to tackle
latger problems.


# The repository

Communication is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of
shared action.


Communication occurs ultimately between individuals. A primary
rule of the speaker is to know the audience. To maintain any
semblance of credibility constrains the orator to speak only of
personal knowledge. Limited time and attention demand brevity.


So I resort to a channel programmers use to collaboratively develop
work: the public code repository. This offers a means for others
to see, reflect upon, and offer feedback on these ideas. Part
observation, part analysis, part education, part proposal it
is the initial attack of a large, ill-defined, unstructured,
complicated problem. It is the start of a software project.


It captures these ideas raw and exposes them in a public forum before
I lose the courage to speak them aloud. These first drafts are
the necessary, albeit embarassing start. The real work lies in the
refactoring ahead.
