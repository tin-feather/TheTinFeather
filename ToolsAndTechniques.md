# Tools and Techniques

How to proceed? More than 30 years of professional work in the
software industry has shown me success and failure in the attempt
to tackle large, ill-defined problems. Today's world contains an
abundance of such problems, surveillance capitalism and invasive
data harvesting only one among many. So I will use the tools I
know and the techniques I have learned to find a way forward,
a way to nurture this nascent social conscience I find in myself.


# Mathematically informed software engineering

I am not a practicing mathematician; while it is where my heart lies,
I do not prove theorems for a living. Furthermore, throughout my
career I have seen many programmers more capable than I. I do,
however, understand more mathematics than most programmers I
meet and find I am a better programmer than most mathematicians I
run across. Consider Tin Feathers, then, a public experiment in
applying mathematically informed software engineering principles
to larger problems of social engineering.


# The repository

Communication is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of
shared action.

Communication occurs ultimately between individuals. A primary
rule of the speaker is to know the audience. To maintain any
semblance of credibility constrains the orator to speak only of
personal knowledge. Limited time and attention demand brevity.

So I resort to a channel programmers use to collaboratively develop
work: the public code repository. This offers a means for others
to see, reflect upon, and offer feedback on these ideas.

It also captures them raw and exposes them in a public forum before I lose
the courage to speak them aloud. This proof of concept is an easy, albeit
embarassing start. The real work lies in the refactoring ahead.
