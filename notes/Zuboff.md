Tine Feather as "counter declaration"

```
I suggest that the kind of resistance that has been offered so far takes the
form of what I call the “counter-declaration.”  A counter-declaration is
defensive. It addresses the institutional facts asserted by the declaration.
The process of countering seeks to impose constraints or achieve compromise,
but it does not annihilate the contested fact. In addressing those facts, it
invariably increases their power.

Uh oh! "...increase their power."

```
I want to be clear that I am not critical of counter-declarations. They are
necessary and vital.  We need more of them. But the point I do want to make is
that counter-declarations alone will not stop this train. They run a race that
they can never win.

```
May we, together, carry forward Frank Schirrmacher’s legacy by sharing in the
author-ship of many great and beautiful new facts that reclaim the digital
future as humanity’s home. Let this be our declaration.
