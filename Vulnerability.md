# Vulnerability

As programmers we know the power of divide and conquer. We use it daily to
confront seemingly insurmountable problems. We know also the difficulties
that arise from complexity: coordination of interacting agents, contested
state, unnecessary coupling, single points of failure.


So too do those who seek to neutralize the aligned power of a united front.
Sowed dissent has long been wielded since, and no doubt before, history's
written record began. The false flag. Fake news. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt.


There are many wrongs in the world today more important than Tin Feathers
in desparate need of redress. But shifting alliances and conflict
between the proponents and advocates of these issues cause dissent
and argument that destroy the power of them all.


How can we avoid this problem? As we do in programming: through decoupling.
Tin Feather's purpose is independent of all others; mathematically,
[orthogonal](https://github.com/tin-feather/TheTinFeather/blob/master/TwoPrinciples.md).
The Tin Feather is worn __to protest surveillance capitalis
and invasive data harvesting.__ It says nothing else. It implies nothing
of political persuasion, sexual prefernce, gender identity, age, race,
religion, or any other classification.


Simplicity is the way to avoid falling victim to such deceits. Simplicity
of message, of purpose, and of goal. Focus is maintained at a point. At a
simple, indivisible singularity.


The unified diversity.
