# On Pronouns

Choice of third person pronouns is an issue in the modern world
that simply did not exist in my youth. As I have said elsewhere, though,
that is an issue
[orthogonal](https://github.com/tin-feather/TheTinFeather/blob/develop/book/TwoPrinciples.md)
to the aims of Tin Feathers. We are the unified diversity.

I do, however,  feel the need to speak of first person pronouns.


"I" or "we"? Both are problematic. The first is egotistical and
pretentious; the second presumptious. Do I have a right to speak for
all? Do I have a right to speak _at all_?


The only sensible conclusion is:
> I have the right to speak. You have the right to ignore me.


I matter not. You may as fruitfully investigate the history and
provenance of the air molecules passing my vocal chords as consider
me. The ideas presented here should stand judgment on their own,
independent of presentation.
