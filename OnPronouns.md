# On Pronouns

Choice of third-person pronoun is an issue of the modern world
that simply did not exist in my youth. Such issues are, however,
[orthogonal](https://github.com/tin-feather/TheTinFeather/blob/develop/book/TwoPrinciples.md)
to the aims of Tin Feathers. I do feel the need to speak briefly
of first-person pronouns.


"I" or "we"? Both are problematic. The first is egotistical and
pretentious; the second presumptious. Do I have a right to speak for
all? Do I have a right to speak _at all_? The only sensible conclusion
is: I have the right to speak. You have the right to ignore me.


More importantly, an "I" matters not to Tin Feathers. Bob Dylan
captures an important truth: "My name it means nothing."
Ideas are universal; they belong to us all. So the Zeitgeist
speaks.


You may as fruitfully investigate the history and provenance of
the air molecules passing my vocal chords as consider me. The
ideas presented here stand in judgment on their own, independent
of presentation and presenter. Significant advantages will follow
from this.


So perhaps a new pronoun is useful:

> &iota;

iota: the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet. A word which means
something inconsequential, "an infinitesimal amount" according to
Mirriam-Webster. I matter not one iota.
