# The Tin Feather

## Birth of a Social Conscience

The Nobel laureate Bob Dylan sang it better than I will ever be<br>able to say it. 
```
My name it means nothing.
My age it means less.
```
Yet precisely because I am no one I presume to speak to everyone.


Birth is trauma. Kicking and fighting we are brought into this world <br>
regardless of our wishes. So it is with a social conscience. I did not<br>
want one. I do not know what to do with it; how to nurture it. Life was<br>
decidedly easier before, but such has fallen to me and I would be<br>
remiss not to give it voice. So the Zeitgeist speaks.


The tin hat is a known symbol in our collective semiology. It captures<br>
the suspicion, mistrust, and paranoia all in technology share regarding<br>
that with which we forge our living. We know these tools all too well;<br>
we are their smiths.


Money, power, influence. Fake news, election tampering. Fortunes made<br>
and fortunes lost. The rest of the world is slowly awakening to what we<br>
have long been aware of, but hiding from. What we tried to laugh off with<br>
a tin hat joke.


I do not know how to fix this world. I know only that the first step is to<br>
acknowledge the problem. That said, we need a forum for discussion,<br>
a common store of information and raw data. We are problem solvers,<br>
after all. Can our 'many eyes' and the 'wisdom of crowds' can solve<br>
these problems? We shall see.


And so the Tin Feather. I wear the first in my hat to admit the problem<br>
and to foster conversation. __To protest surveillance capitalism and<br>
invasive data harvesting.__ I lay before you not a gauntlet, but a mere<br>
feather. Now take it up.


The tin feather... when a tin hat is too heavy.
