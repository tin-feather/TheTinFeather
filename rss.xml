And from a respected academic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this a nice idea. And yes, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; suppose it is necessary to encode regulations
in law. But will the academics and law-makers ever realize that all their laws
and regulations will not stop the problem? Do they not realize that
government security agencies will ignore the law? Are they so naive as to assume
that capitalist businesses will respect regulations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This djinni is well and truly out of the bottle. Thermodynamics has a few words
to say about reversing such things. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; shouldn't need to elaborate further …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our challenge is to figure out to deal with the reality facing us now and into
the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://tinfeathers.org/posts/a-nice-idea/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2019 08:34:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>In the Trenches with Ethereum</title><link>http://tinfeathers.org/posts/in-the-trenches/</link><dc:creator>Feather Tin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; have not fallen off the earth … or been picked up by the black
helicopters. A call to arms is exciting: the first rush of emotion, the
excitement of new ideas, the sheer challenges of communication and motivation.
But battles are won and lost in the trenches and trenches are generally not
pleasant places. So be it. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; am in the trenches studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper"&gt;Ethereum yellow paper&lt;/a&gt; is not the sort of thing to read with a beer in
your hand and your feet up. It takes a little more concentration than that.
Early stages yet, too early, in fact, to know if it will be useful. It is, at
least, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

somewhat directionless single white male turning to a popular video streaming
service and getting sucked down an alt-right rabbit hole. This particular
individual realized what had happened, changed political agendas, and is
participating in a left-leaning counter action. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; do not wish to discuss
politics either way but instead want to make an observation about medical
packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These approaches and software packages, even the ones that have failed to catch
on in the past, may be worth rethinking since so-called "serverless computing"
has become a thing. Yes, it is in the cloud, but it is transient. Can we make
the vulnerable parts of some of these systems transient and thereby lessen their
vulnerability?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much to learn. So much to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://tinfeathers.org/posts/so-much-to-learn/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2019 21:40:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On Building Consensus</title><link>http://tinfeathers.org/posts/on-building-consensus/</link><dc:creator>Feather Tin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effect change we must work together. Reform is thwarted if we fail to come
together in sufficient number or fail to stay united for sufficient time. Those
looking to maintain the status quo know this and use fear, uncertainty, and
doubt to sow disunity and exaggerate differences leading to the ineffective
polarization seen so widely these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

stated purposes of this blog: &lt;strong&gt;to protest surveillance capitalism and invasive
data harvesting&lt;/strong&gt;. The first step debugging a problem is to reliably exhibit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; a bug, however, requires more. How do we make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We (programmers, geeks, techies … call us what you will) may be slow to
anger, slow to indignation. We take a long time to make up our minds. But you
know what? That is because it takes time to reach truth. But once we find it,
we stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how all those "thought leaders" and "visionaries" get on pounding
their own code at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://tinfeathers.org/posts/hopeful-news/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2019 08:51:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Two Principles</title><link>http://tinfeathers.org/posts/two-principles/</link><dc:creator>Feather Tin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than thirty years ago on a windy autumn day the breeze attempted to make
off with the trilby of a distinguished looking, but not terribly fit old man.
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; recovered and returned said hat. The short conversation we shared over
the few following blocks has stayed with me to this day as a strange, almost
dream-like memory.&lt;/p&gt;

today's media, both within our community and beyond. That is the matter of data
security. While sceptical of absolutes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; have studied enough mathematics to
recognize such a rarity when one appears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no such thing as secure data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that can be re-worded to be more easily remembered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="there-is-no-such-thing-as-secure-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SECURE DATA!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day it seems there are reports of newer and larger data breaches. Customer
data, government data, health data. On and on without end. One would think that
by now people would realize that there simply is no way to secure data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Secure data" is an oxymoron. You have a birthday, as does every person on the
planet. That is a &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt;. You know it. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; do not. Now record that fact and it
becomes &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;. The defining characteristic of &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; is that it can be recalled.
Write it on a piece of paper and someone can read it. Record it and someone can
play it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a fact can not be recovered it is not &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;. Relational database management
systems exist to facilitate data recall. SQL searches, indexing, back-up and
redundancy. These all exist to let people recover stored facts, to manage &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within information technology we discuss and debate techniques aimed at securing
database systems. Reading such works, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; can not help thinking of medieval
architects designing ever larger and elaborate keeps, castles, and walled towns.
Despite all their technological advances, it is well known that when such
fortifications fell, it was most often not by force but through human action,
accidental or treasonous. All modern database systems incorporate
the same vulnerability. They are designed to allow the data to be recalled and
read and processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once recalled? That data can leak. Why do we act so surprised?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://tinfeathers.org/posts/on-data-security/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2019 20:19:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On the Task at Hand</title><link>http://tinfeathers.org/posts/on-the-task-at-hand/</link><dc:creator>Feather Tin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Done with introductions, we come now to the task at hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To protest surveillance capitalism and invasive data harvesting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cause both noble and just… perhaps sufficiently quixotic to warrant your
attention? To save you the effort, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\iota\)&lt;/span&gt; offer this cost-benefit analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Your cost:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class="first last"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time it takes to read these words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Your benefit:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class="first last"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;worst case – a curmudgeon's smirk at my futile histrionics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;best case – new insights into our industry, our community, and their
context in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The risk:&lt;/li&gt;
