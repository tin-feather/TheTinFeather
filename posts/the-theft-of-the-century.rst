It is happening as we watch. Right under our noses. The greatest theft of data,
the boldest, most egregious act of invasive data harvesting by the surveillance
capitalists yet. Will it be beat in the next 81 year? |I| doubt it. Years of
planning and execution.  What is it?

Brexit.

Data theft? Yes, indeed. The light_ bulbs_ have finally switched on for me. Let me
explain.

It is clear that the US wants Brexit. If it goes through it is obvious that the
US will have the UK over the proverbial barrel when it comes to negotiating a
new trade deal. What |I| did not realize until now, however, was what it is that
the US wants. The answer? Data, health-care data; that of the NHS.

It is clear that the US wants to shove their chlorinated cocks down UK throats.
Kill the chickens and chop them up in any old abattoir, clean or not so clean.
Just dip them in bleach before you wrap them up and they'll be fine. Well,
the European Union doesn't quite agree; no American chickens export to the EU
market. After Brexit, though, desperate for a trade deal, the UK will simply not
be able to say no.

But the UK market for chicken is just not big enough to explain all the effort
and planning that has gone into Brexit. Remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal_
that no one seems to talk about any longer? The one that showed how the powers
of surveillance capitalism had been used to manipulate the Brexit vote? No?
Doesn't ring any bells?

Now the news is all about the details and the haggling to come. Nobody seems to
consider that the whole decision has these huge question marks hanging over it.

That is because the UK has something much more valuable than a few folk who like
a chicken curry. It has a nationalized health service that has decades of data
on millions of people's lives, cradle to grave. All with a single owner, the NHS.

Now *that* is a prize that explains the effort put into Cambridge Analytica and
all that has followed. Northern Ireland? Scottish independence? Noise on the
signal. The NHS data set is what is driving Brexit. Got to get it free of GDPR.
Got to get some leverage for the license deal negotiation.

(The irony is just incredible. All those free market capitalist against
socialized medicine for all those decades have suddenly realized that socialized
medicine has created perhaps the single most valuable data asset on the planet.)

If Brexit happens how much do you want to bet that the UK's Prime Minister will
be sitting on the board of some American health-care conglomerate by 2025? Sure,
a former deputy PM is already at Facebook.
