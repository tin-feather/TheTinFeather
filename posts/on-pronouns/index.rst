Choice of third-person pronoun is an issue of the modern world that simply did
not exist in my youth. Such issues are, however, orthogonal to the aims of Tin
Feathers. I do feel the need to speak briefly of first-person pronouns.

"I" or "we"? Both are problematic. The first is egotistical and pretentious; the
second presumptuous. Do I have a right to speak for all? Do I have a right to
speak *at all*? The only sensible conclusion is: I have the right to speak. You
have the right to ignore me.

More importantly, an "I" matters not to Tin Feathers. Bob Dylan captures an
important truth: "My name it means nothing." Ideas are universal; they belong to
us all. So the Zeitgeist speaks.

You may as fruitfully investigate the history and provenance of the air
molecules passing my vocal chords as consider me. The ideas presented here stand
in judgment on their own, independent of presentation and presenter. Significant
advantages will follow from this.

So perhaps a new pronoun is useful:

|I|

*iota*: the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet. Also an English word which means
something inconsequential, "an infinitesimal amount" according to Mirriam-Webster.

|I| matter not one iota.
