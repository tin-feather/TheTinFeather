|I| have not fallen off the earth |...| or been picked up by the black
helicopters. A call to arms is exciting: the first rush of emotion, the
excitement of new ideas, the sheer challenges of communication and motivation.
But battles are won and lost in the trenches and trenches are generally not
pleasant places. So be it. |I| am in the trenches studying.

The `Ethereum yellow paper`_ is not the sort of thing to read with a beer in
your hand and your feet up. It takes a little more concentration than that.
Early stages yet, too early, in fact, to know if it will be useful. It is, at
least, interesting.

Is it fair to summarize Ethereum as follows?

Citizen science computational projects are fairly well known and pretty cool.
Think things like `SETI@home`_ or `FOLDING@HOME`_. Together we have a
supercomputer at our disposal and projects like these attempt to figure out how
to use it collectively. Participants voluntarily download and run software with
no financial consideration.

Decentralization is also a powerful and useful thing; think git or Bittorent.

Ethereum appears to be an attempt to combine these ideas:

1. It is decentralized.
2. It wants to work with arbitrary code.
3. It wants participants to be paid for their computational efforts.

Once money is involved, however, there are trust issues to handle. Running code
costs resources (electricity) so participants want to know that they will be
paid. People paying for their code to be run want to make sure that participants
actually execute it and do not cheat. With no centralized authority, how can
this be handled?

The Ethereum developers created a blockchain-based currency, the Ether, to
satisfy these trust issues. Participants are paid Ether for executing so called
smart contracts written in a Turing complete langauge.

It appears the developers recognized the ecological disaster that is proof of
work and have built in some planned obsolescence of its use to force the system
to evolve to a smarter proof of stake algorithm. It also looks like this has
already been delayed. Hmmmm |...|

Is this a fair summary? It is early days and |I| am still working through a lot
of material. Please comment below to help guide the investigation.
