A friend sent me a link_ to an article repeating the too oft told story of a
somewhat directionless single white male turning to a popular video streaming
service and getting sucked down an alt-right rabbit hole. This particular
individual realized what had happened, changed political agendas, and is
participating in a left-leaning counter action. |I| do not wish to discuss
politics either way but instead want to make an observation about medical
packaging.

The idea that blister packs for medications could lessen drug-induced suicides
appears to have taken hold in 2013. A simple search shows articles, including
one from that same source_, discussing the simplicity and effectiveness of such
a solution. While it is a physically simple act to swallow 30 or 40 pills from a
bottle, the deliberation required to push the same number from blister packs has
been shown to drastically lower the number of suicide attempts through such means.

What if video streaming services did not have auto-play and such ubiquitous "Up
next" suggestions? Would that be enough to lessen the risk of radicalization?
The subject of the first article eventually realized how an algorithm fed him
increasingly extreme points of view, leading him to conclusions he would not
otherwise have reached. Would he have deliberately sought out such material if
it had not been presented in the same browser pane? Just one tantalizing, click
baity link away?

Counter accusations of nanny-state interventionism arise against the practice of
blister packs for dangerous medications. Say what you will of pharmaceutical
companies, but we are not yet to the point where medication slips itself into
our mouths, and invites us to simply swallow. At least not yet |...|

|I| think it is time finally to look into Greasemonkey_ and start writing some
plug-ins.
