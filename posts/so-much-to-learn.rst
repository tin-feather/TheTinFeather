So much to learn! Tor, IPFS, I2P, Tribler |...|

These approaches and software packages, even the ones that have failed to catch
on in the past, may be worth rethinking since so-called "serverless computing"
has become a thing. Yes, it is in the cloud, but it is transient. Can we make
the vulnerable parts of some of these systems transient and thereby lessen their
vulnerability?

So much to learn. So much to ponder.
