A public complaint can serve to raise awareness of a problem and is one of the
stated purposes of this blog: **to protest surveillance capitalism and invasive
data harvesting**. The first step debugging a problem is to reliably exhibit it.

To *fix* a bug, however, requires more. How do we make a difference?

Alone
=====
The simplest way to effect large change in the world is to do so individually
as a super hero using super powers, an option not open to many of us. Whether or
not the current popularity of super hero movies contributes to the status quo by
convincing us of our inability to make a difference individually is an
interesting question, but one that would take us too far afield.

An equally effective yet unrealistic means is to be the ordinary man, woman, or
even child, thrust into the role of hero and placed, through a serious of
circuitous circumstances, in front of the very switch that will bring down an
entire evil empire. How many science fiction movies, while entertaining,
disappoint by presenting a alien race from a civilization capable of
intergalactic travel yet unaware of the dangerous vulnerability of a single
point of failure?

In lieu of heroic super powers and sympathetic screen writers we come to
communal action. Taking a page from history, from the work of E O Wilson, or
a tune from the Beatles, we must `Come Together`_ to accomplish any change we
wish to see in this world.

Together
========
This still leaves many options to consider. An obvious way to achieve group
action is to control an existing group. To do so requires being in a leadership
position of an existing organisation. Politics anyone? Like many in the
programmer community |I| do not feel |I| have the skills, talent, or inclination
to pursue such a path.

A second obvious option is to build a new organisation, thereby being the
leader by fiat. While this approach undeniably works for some [`cough, cough`_]
|I| consider it `very naughty`_.

So we are left to ponder further. How can a small force have a large effect?
Amplification? Archimedes said, "Give me where to stand and I shall move the
Earth." He's right, but in this case it just takes us back to the super hero,
Iron Man instead of Super Man, but not our answer.

Huge store of potential energy can have a large effect. Takes only a small force
to dislodge a key stone. Where is the potential? Need to bring together. Align.
Synchronize |...|


Resonance
=========
Who of us hasn't marvelled at `Galloping Gertie`_? The Tacoma Narrows Bridge.
Resonance. That is the answer. Many small effects that sum together to create a
huge one. Coherence. A laser bean can cut steel. Individually we can not change
much. Realistically we can only change ourselves, but if we align, if we get
into resonance, we become a force to be reckoned. There is huge potential energy
in the dissatisfaction and indignation that has grown within our community
against surveillance capitalism. All we need do is liberate and direct it.

This is *right*; it rings true. It explains so much. Consider.

- Tin Feathers will be distributed.

Git is distributed. Bittorrent is distributed. "Distributed" is good, a powerful
concept common in so much software |I| respect.

- Tin Feathers will be decentralized.

Block chain is decentralized. It has other problems, but "decentralized" is good.
Another key concept.

Distributed and decentralized appeals to the anarchist in us all, sceptical of
big organisations from political parties to corporate enterprises.

- Tin Feathers draws on our collective indignation and resentment.

Finally |I| know why **Fight Club** echos so strongly in my head. It captures so
well the erupting potential of the dissatisfied and disenfranchised. We don't
need to drop any buildings, but there are things going on that need to stop.

- Tin Feathers is not an organization; it has no leader.

|I| am compelled to do this and yet the last thing on earth |I| want to do is
lead. Now it makes sense |...| |I|'m not. Nobody is telling you what to do. Tin
Feathers is just the whisper in your ear voicing what you already know.

The thoughts in my head are not unique. All Tin Feathers need do is sound the
note that will awaken a resonance among us all. Together we have the skills and
experience to figure out what to do, how to debug this problem.
