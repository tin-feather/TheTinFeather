To effect change we must work together. Reform is thwarted if we fail to come
together in sufficient number or fail to stay united for sufficient time. Those
looking to maintain the status quo know this and use fear, uncertainty, and
doubt to sow disunity and exaggerate differences leading to the ineffective
polarization seen so widely these days.

What can we do?

.. END_TEASER

To begin with, as programmers we need to recognize "divide and conquer" when we
see it. We use it every day to tackle the problems we face writing code and
understand well how it works. Let us not fall prey to it ourselves.

To unite at scale and maintain cohesion we apply two further venerable tools of
software development: the `KISS principle`_ and `de Morgan's law`_. To form a
group requires potential members agree to all the aims and principles of the
group, each and every criteria. The membership decision is the logical product
of agreement with each criteria. Potential members must agree to #1 *and* #2 *and*
#3 and so on. De Morgan's law tells us that one single failure, one disagreement,
is enough fail the chain of logical ANDs thereby preventing membership.

This is simple first order logic. Even if unrecognized as such, it is well known
throughout the programming community. Eugenia Cheng's **The Art of Logic**
explains this in more detail to a wider audience and is highly recommended.

So how will Tin Feathers maximize numbers? Apply the KISS principle and "keep it
simple, stupid." If we have just one single aim then we will find many who agree
with it. That aim is **to protest surveillance capitalism and invasive data
harvesting**. Nice and simple.

Tin Feathers is not telling you what to do. It is not telling you what to buy.
It is not about making "life style choices." Tin Feathers is not telling you
what to think. It is simply telling you something you already know |--| that
surveillance capitalism has gotten out of hand |--| and pointing out that you
are not alone in that realisation.

This is what unites us. Programmers are a diverse group, not diverse enough yet,
but still varied in many ways. Diversity is good and provides the rich range of
experiences that we will need to come up with solutions to this problem. Our
differences, however, are orthogonal to our purpose and we must not let them be
used to divide and conquer us before we get started.
