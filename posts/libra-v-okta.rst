Identity Management Services
============================

Libra_ was pretty scary for a while, at least until it became clear that Facebook
was not going to be able to pull it off. A phrase |I| recently ran across
reminded me of something |I| saw in the Libra aftermath, though. *Identity
Management Service*. Libra wasn't trying to take control of all our money, they
said. They were just looking to establish themselves as an identity management
service.

Thankfully, they failed. I suspect a lot of the blame lies with Zuckerberg
himself given the degree of control he maintains over the company. |I| can
imagine him thinking that he has control of a great portion of the world's
population, pondering how to get control of the rest. "Money. Everyone spends
money. If I control their money I can control them." Perhaps unfair, but it's
my imagination.

What he failed to realize, though, is that people *care* about their money. And
other people care about other peoples' money. In short, financial industries
are highly, highly regulated.

Now consider Okta_. They also offer identity management services. For all your
clients and all your employees. For all an *enterprise's* clients and employees.
This is Enterprise Software!

What difference does that make? Think about it |...| enterprise software. We all
know too much about enterprise software. Nobody cares about it. Nobody gives
much of a damn about the software the enterprise uses. Enterprise software is
not regulated.

But it entraps everybody. Every single one of us. Like a tar pit. Any one who
has a job. Any one who has ever had to fill out a human resources form. Every
one who receives a paycheck.

Okta doesn't control us when we go to spend our money; they control us before we
even earn it.

Libra : 0. Okta : 1.

Game over, folks.
