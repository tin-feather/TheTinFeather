Many years ago |I| saw a demonstration of software for navigating super tankers.
The graphical display showed a nautical chart updating in real time centered on
the ship's current location. Extending from the front of the ship's icon  was a
long red line representing the vessel's stopping distance. The end of this line
showed where the ship would be roughly 20 minutes in the future, the amount of
time it would take to stop. If this line touched shore alarms went off. Loud
ones.

Rightly so. Without corrective action, the ship would run aground. T minus 20
minutes until oil spill and natural disaster.

|I| tell this story to defend accusations of paranoia. Think of the views
expressed here as that red line. Tin Feathers provides a warning of what could
happen given the current direction technology and society are heading. Consider
mine a voice raised in concern. Will we see the worst or will corrective action
be taken? We all better pay attention.
