Yet another article_ warning about the abuse of facial-recognition technology.
And from a respected academic.

Yes, this a nice idea. And yes, |I| suppose it is necessary to encode regulations
in law. But will the academics and law-makers ever realize that all their laws
and regulations will not stop the problem? Do they not realize that
government security agencies will ignore the law? Are they so naive as to assume
that capitalist businesses will respect regulations?

This djinni is well and truly out of the bottle. Thermodynamics has a few words
to say about reversing such things. |I| shouldn't need to elaborate further |...|

Our challenge is to figure out to deal with the reality facing us now and into
the future.
