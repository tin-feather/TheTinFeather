    "**If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.**"

    -- Isaac Newton, 1675

This well known quotation expresses an idea that lies at the foundations of the
scientific tradition, mathematics, and open source software, three of the top
intellectual achievements of the human species. Yet in literature it goes unused.
The scientist, mathematician, and programmer readily appropriate and re-purpose
ideas from our predecessors while most authors seem to aim for an entirely
personal creative work.

Thankfully, |I| am not an author and this is nothing so formal as a "work of
literature." Yet |I| do have ideas to share and know communication requires
shared semantics. These may be found in a set of mathematical axioms, a computer
programming language, but also in a popular movie, in song lyrics, and within
comedy. In the name of pragmatism and due to the urgency of the task at hand |I|
will make free use of all these sources, the profound to the profane, confident
of their effect, with respect, and in hopeful anticipation of their originators'
approval.


    "**I am Jack's betrayed sense of privacy.**"

    -- after the Narrator, **Fight Club**,
       Chuck Palahnuik
