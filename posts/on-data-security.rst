As an IT professional |I| feel obliged to clear up a matter oft overlooked in
today's media, both within our community and beyond. That is the matter of data
security. While sceptical of absolutes |I| have studied enough mathematics to
recognize such a rarity when one appears:

**There is no such thing as secure data.**

Perhaps that can be re-worded to be more easily remembered:

**THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SECURE DATA!!!**
--------------------------------------------


Every day it seems there are reports of newer and larger data breaches. Customer
data, government data, health data. On and on without end. One would think that
by now people would realize that there simply is no way to secure data.

"Secure data" is an oxymoron. You have a birthday, as does every person on the
planet. That is a *fact*. You know it. |I| do not. Now record that fact and it
becomes *data*. The defining characteristic of *data* is that it can be recalled.
Write it on a piece of paper and someone can read it. Record it and someone can
play it back.

If a fact can not be recovered it is not *data*. Relational database management
systems exist to facilitate data recall. SQL searches, indexing, back-up and
redundancy. These all exist to let people recover stored facts, to manage *data*.

Within information technology we discuss and debate techniques aimed at securing
database systems. Reading such works, |I| can not help thinking of medieval
architects designing ever larger and elaborate keeps, castles, and walled towns.
Despite all their technological advances, it is well known that when such
fortifications fell, it was most often not by force but through human action,
accidental or treasonous. All modern database systems incorporate
the same vulnerability. They are designed to allow the data to be recalled and
read and processed.

And once recalled? That data can leak. Why do we act so surprised?
