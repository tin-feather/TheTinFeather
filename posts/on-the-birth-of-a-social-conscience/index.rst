The Nobel laureate Bob Dylan sang it better than I will ever be able to say it.
    | *My name it means nothing.*
    | *My age it means less.*

Yet precisely because I am no one I presume to speak to everyone.

Birth is trauma. Kicking and fighting we are brought into this world regardless
of our wishes. So it is with a social conscience. I did not want one. I do not
know what to do with it; how to nurture it. Life was decidedly easier before,
but such has fallen to me and I would be remiss not to give it voice. So the
Zeitgeist speaks.

The tin foil hat is a known symbol in our collective semiology. It captures the
suspicion, mistrust, and paranoia all in technology share regarding that with
which we forge our living. We know these tools all too well; we are their smiths.

Money, power, influence. Fake news, election tampering. Fortunes made and
fortunes lost. The rest of the world is slowly awakening to what we have long
been aware of, but hiding from. What we tried to laugh off with a tin hat joke.

I do not know how to fix this world. I know only that the first step is to
acknowledge the problem. That said, we need a forum for discussion, a common
store of information and raw data. We are problem solvers, after all. Can our
"many eyes" and the "wisdom of crowds" solve these problems? We shall see.

And so the Tin Feather. I wear the first in my hat to admit the problem and to
foster conversation. **To protest surveillance capitalism and invasive data
harvesting.** I lay before you not a gauntlet, but merely a feather. Now take it
up.

The tin feather... when a tin hat is too heavy.
