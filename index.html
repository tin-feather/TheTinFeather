    <div>
<p><span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am beginning to <em>get</em> cloud computing. While <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> come from the "dev" side of
DevOps <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am starting to understand the operational advantages of a cloud
architecture. After all, it is hard to ignore the deluge of articles and
evangelism presenting the myriad benefits of cloud. But <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> don't want to speak
of any of that. Instead <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> want to tell a story about war and technology and
smart people putting 2 and 2 together.</p>
<div class="section" id="connecting-dots">
<h2>Connecting Dots...</h2>
<p>In the 1990s <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> met and worked with many programmers from the Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) arena. From them <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> learned the basics of how the
Global Positioning System (GPS) developed and run by the United States military
works. This was before the days of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">Wikipedia</a> where you can learn much more
today, but back then <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> was fascinated by one story in particular.</p>
<p>GPS signals have been available for civilian use since the 1980s. The signal is
purposely degraded by an introduced error to prevent the system being used for
purposes unapproved by its owners, the United States government. This introduced
error can be switched on and off, and the entire signal can be denied to civilian
devices altogther when the error is removed.</p>
<p>The man <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> met spoke of a GIS conference that took place when the United States
was on the verge of military action. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> do not remeber the particular event he
was describing, but, as you will shortly see, that is not relevant to this story.
Contemplated military action is news worthy and there was much in the media.
Would the US act? Wouldn't it? Should it? Shouldn't it? Then as now, the news
was full of many views and opinions. The timing of any action, however, was not
revealed before hand.</p>
<p>And so we come to a table of GIS practioners, sharing lunch during a conference,
many of them with GPS devices. Today such things are common place in our smart
phones but in those days it was only at such a gathering that many would be
seen together. During lunch, this man's GPS device suddenly lost signal. So, too,
did his neighbor's. And across the table. Everyone's device suddenly lost signal.</p>
<p>A silence fell, he recalled, as they realized the cause. Civilian GPS access had
been switched off. Why? They knew if the error was switched off, public access
would also be stopped. Why would the error be switched off? <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> was still in the
dark until he explained that at the moment of invasion, the error is removed to
enable the invading Marines to set up local base stations with full accuracy.
Within minutes the error can be reintroduced; the invading forces can
account for it using their accurate local base stations.</p>
<p>The civilian signal was only off for the span of a few minutes, but that group
not only noticed, they knew what it meant. Half way around the planet, they knew
before any news report confirmed it: the Marines had gone in.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-more-dots">
<h2>... and More Dots</h2>
<p>So what does this have to do with cloud computing architectures?</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am still reading Shoshana Zuboff's excellent and disturbing, <strong>The Age of
Surveillance Capitalism</strong>. Within it, she defines and recounts the genesis,
methodologies, and ongoing aims of this new form capitalism. Through a series of
innovations and accidents of history, its originators discovered the predictive
value of what she terms "behavioral surplus." In information technology we know
this as "metadata."</p>
<p>Those GIS professionals were the first civilians in the Western world to know
the very moment, to the minute, when a military invasion began a half a world
away. Such is the power of metadata analysis. Eight people, sitting around a
lunch table... and they knew!</p>
<p>Today's surveillance capitalists have created and continue to grow empires from
the behavioral surplus – the metadata – of our lives. Every search and
click and "like." Zuboff's anlaysis is thorough and chilling. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am eager to
see if she tells of what <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> report here. If she does <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> will know that <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span>
understand her; if she doesn't then this may be my first contribution to the
cause.</p>
<p>Consider: We know from her of the rapacious and insatiable appetite of
surveillance capitalist for ever increasing sources of behavioral surplus. We
know, too, of the astronomical profits they reap from the predicative and
frightenlingly manipulative value they derive from their appropriation of such
metadata.</p>
<p>And know they invite us to run all of our software on their hardware, in their
data centers. Why? Is it simply to ease our operational problems? To make our
lives easier? It may do that, but there will be two costs we pay. First and
publically for the service. As each instance spins up and spins down. But we
will pay again through the metadata they claim as their own.</p>
<p>Imagine you are running an application that deals with shares: tracking,
trading, anything; many shares, across many markets. To load balance you divide
the work based on ticker symbol. Your cloud instances will spin up and down
based on load: A-B, C-D, E-F, G-H, and so on. Suddenly your application spins
up 100 more instances. Maybe this is done by someone at your company, maybe it
happens automatically because you wrote a smart application that monitors its
internal latencies and throughputs.</p>
<p>Would it be fair to conclude that 100 new instances spinning up imply an
increased load or the anticipation of such? So, this load... is it for tickers
that start with A-B or G-H or M-N? What could you conclude from knowing that?
Could a guess be made as to whose shares are going to see action? The data
within the application remains private, but the metadata of instances starting
and stopping yields volumes of information itself.</p>
<p>While easy to explain, such a scenario is unlikely to happen to any large
investment bank. Such canny customers have long known the importance of even
the smallest scraps of information. Perhaps this explains the "hybrid solutions"
cloud vendors are starting to offer: their cloud infrastructure, hosted on
premise in private data centers. Will the investment banks trust them?</p>
<p>Block chain technology is often presented as a privacy panacea these days. The
number of band wagons <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> have seen roll by in my career engenders a certain
scepticiism in me as new ones appear, but block chain may yet have its uses.
<span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> do not know enough to embrace or dismiss it entirely. Let's put down a
few dots we all know and see what connections we make.</p>
<p>Proof of work in block chain implementations takes a lot of compute power.
Cloud vendors, eager for this business,  are offering nodes and instances primed
for such compute intensive jobs. We also read that cloud technology has advanced
to the point where instances can be migrated between servers on the fly.</p>
<p>So imagine a rack of servers in a cloud that suddenly starts running hot. Power
consumption soars. A smart cloud will move jobs as necessary to even the load.
In distributing such loads, the cloud vendor will know whose jobs are running
hottest. They will know who is doing a lot of proof of work. They may not know
why, but they will know when. When the load grows, when it drops, when it stops.
Does that sound like something block chain evangelist will approve? Block chains
may keep their ledgers anonymous and secure, but they leak metadata like
everything else.</p>
<p>Lots of isolated data points, meaningless dots... But what can you conclude
from connecting those dot to millions of others? Dots from apps that track
shares, that allocate rides, that order pizza, that control power stations, that
monitor crops, that sense frosts in orchards...</p>
<p>Surveillance capitalist have appropriated behavioral surplus from everything we
do and use it to infer more about us than we know of ourselves. With their
cloud architectures they are now aiming to do the very same thing to the
corporations for which we work, to every application we write, from IoT to
enterprise to government to public service. Everything that runs "in the cloud,"
grist to their mills</p>

understand now why the vendors present it as "the new <em>golden</em> age of cloud."</p>

<p>The current presentation of this material is still evolving. It is more
important to capture these ideas as the Muse offers them than it is to polish
their presentation. A few words of disclaimer and apology are in order.</p>
<p>The format of this work is guided by the following considerations:</p>
<p>1. Communication occurs between individuals. The primary rule of the speaker,
"Know your audience," is familiar even to those untrained in the art of rhetoric.</p>
<p>2. To maintain any semblance of credibility the orator must speak only from
personal knowledge.</p>
<p>3. Limited time both to read and to write, competing claims on attention, and
the material's urgency demand brevity.</p>
<div class="section" id="on-audience">
<h2>On Audience</h2>
<p><span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am not a practicing mathematician; while my heart lies in mathematics,
<span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> do not prove theorems for a living. Furthermore, throughout my career
<span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> have seen many programmers more capable than <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> do, however,
understand more mathematics than most programmers <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> meet and find <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am
more comfortable developing code than most mathematicians <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> run across. Tin
Feathers, then, is a public experiment in the application of mathematically
informed software engineering principles to larger problems of social
engineering.</p>
<p>Its earliest audience is the information technology community of which <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span>
am a part. There is a lot to cover and little time. Many ideas from the history
and practice of computer science will be referenced with a degree of familiarty
assumed. These will range from the theoretical to the humorous. If you have
found your way to these words, perhaps directed by a friend from this community,
please ask them if you do not understand any particular point.</p>
<p>The over arching aim of this exercise is to build a united community to address
the issues of surveillance capitalism and invasive data harvesting. While
orignating in monolog, dialog will be more important. However, due to my
personal inexperience of the mechanics of blogging and digital social
interaction in general this may take some time to get right. Please bear with
me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-style">
<h2>On Style</h2>
<p>Brevity is important. So too is a style sufficiently captivating to ensure an
audience. Style is important to get readers.</p>
<p>To me that second sentence is more readable than the third, perhaps explaining
why <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> also find it more writeable. In the struggle to capture and present
this material <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> fear the fickle nature of inspiration and know that at any
moment <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> may lose both the content and the courage to speak these words.
So what of voice and style?</p>
<p>Lacking sufficient training in the literary arts <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> simply give rein to the
Muse and aim for a voice that lets the dictation proceed at a fluent pace.
Editting can come later. Polish must wait. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> record the imagined spoken
word, not as internal dialog, but as if listening to another. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> aim to keep
my own interest in both style and content.</p>
<p>Does it work? If you are reading this, there is hope. Please continue, paying
more attention to what <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> say than how <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> say it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-method">
<h2>On Method</h2>
<p>Is this material best offered as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>book</li>
<li>blog</li>
<li>wiki</li>
<li>lecture</li>
<li>sermon</li>
<li>rant</li>
<li>chautauqua</li>
<li>pamphlet</li>
<li>interactive non-fiction</li>
</ul>
<p>While the possibilities of today's internet have far outstripped what <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span>
imagine were even the wildest dreams of Johannes Gutenberg, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> know not how
best to proceed. Having avoided all things remotely resembling "social media" up
to now <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> suddenly find myself with a message to share. You see the dilemma
that immediatley presents itself. How to reach an audience? How to foster
dialog? How to come together socially and digitally? For now <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> will trust my
instincts and reach for a Python-based blogging platform, Nikola. Is that the
right answer? <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> do not know.</p>
<p>So be it. Capture preceeds all. My hope is that initial, imperfect sharing
may not only reach someone with the skills necessary to improve presentation but
also inspire them sufficiently to "join the cause." Let that be the first public
milestone.</p>

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <div>
<p>Tin Feathers has rapidly evolved through multiple stages in the course of the
first serious consideration of the idea.</p>
<p>It began as a joke. Within the programmer community as elsewhere, there exists
individuals and organizations whose ideas of reality, both scientific
and social, are, to put it tactfully a few standard deviations from the norm.
Consider the Flat Earth Society, an organization whose ideas of planetary
physics and geography contrast strongly with the more widely accepted model of
the scientific community. Or consider those who believe the world to be run by
an alien race of lizard people that live disguised amongst us.</p>
<p>It is common within information technology to jokingly describe such people as
"wearing a tin foil hat." The provenance of this particular label lies in the
claimed ability of such a fashion accessory to protect the wearer from "space
rays used to control the mind." While a Faraday cage is known to protect an
environment from stray elecromagnetic radiation and as such, is an important
component of certain scientific experiments, the protection afforded by a "tin
foil hat" is, as you can imagine, a somewhat less established phenomenon.</p>
<p>The original joke of the Tin Feather was as a logo for Tin Feather Industries, a
fictitious company that would sell merchandise to protect buyers from excessive
surveillance and invasion of privacy. Numerous products were imagined that would
be marketed to the paranoid end of a tin-foil-hat-wearing customer base.</p>
<p>Satire can be a powerful means to make statements and focus people's attention.
Upon consideration of the unreasonable extent to which our actions in this world
are tracked and recorded and tallied, both physically and digitally, it was
quickly realized that such a joke could be used to raise awareness of this
social problem. It might actually do some good in the world.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this took place knowing the neologism "surveillance
capitalism" but in ignorance of its author or the seriousness of the issues that
that practice implies. Personal resentment and indignation were enough to
intitiate action leading me to put words to paper -- more literally, bytes into
files.</p>
<p>A few thousand words later, though, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> realized that a more important "good"
could be achieved through Tin Feathers than simply a joke with a jag. Raising
awareness of a problem is important. However, successful wide-spread adoption
of the Tin Feather as an icon protesting surveillance capitalism and invasive
data harvesting amongst the programmer community would be more. It would be a
proof of concept to that same community of a way to come together to effect
social change. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> write of this elsewhere in more detail; let me simply
state here that the software industry has a collection of techniques that could
be valuably applied to the complex problems the world faces today. That same
community, however, shares certain social traits that have, in my opinion,
prevented it from making the full contribution it could.</p>
<p>But programmers know algorithms; they are our bread and butter. We apply them
to solve our problems and we adapt them to attack similar ones. If Tin Feathers
worked as an icon, its greatest benefit might not be raising awarness of one
particular problem, but in serving as a known solution – a proof of concept
– demonstraing how to mobilize the programming community, their skills, and
their talents in tackling the many serious issues the world faces today. This
convinced me that the Tin Feathers programme was worth pursuing.</p>
<p>How then to protest surveillance capitalism and invasive data harvesting?
Proceed using the knowledge and techniques of mathematically informed software
engineering. Detailed analysis is reported elsewhere, but note those first
words: "to protest." Consideration of that alone leads to many points relevant
to protest movements of any nature and human social interaction in general. One
idea in particular struck me as both critically important and widely
unrecognized. A subtle, yet simple mathematical concept which, widely known
would prevent much of the strife seen in today's world and facilitate the common
action needed to address social ills. Surprising myself, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> realized that after
more than half a century on this planet <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> might have something to say to other
people. With a strange mixture of fear, exhilaration, and dread <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> realized
that they might actually benefit by listening.</p>
<p>This is far, far, <em>far</em> beyond my comfort zone as is confessed elsewhere, but
know that it is this that drives me to write and share these words. The
contribution <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> offer is made in the belief that it is unknown to the wider
information technology audience <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> address and that, as a member of that
community <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am in a unique position to deliver it. In doing so <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> draw
courage and inspiration seeing the greater effort to which Eugenia Cheng goes in
trying to teach a broader audience more mathematically sophisticated material.
In <strong>The Art of Logic</strong> she aims to teach that noble subject to people from all
walks of life, to teach us "How to make sense in a world that doesn't." If she
can do this with such style and grace and optimism, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> must at least attempt
to persuade an already logical audience of computer programmers of the wider
relevance of one mathematical concept we already use.</p>
<p>Continued analysis of the Tin Feather programme requires knowledge of the source
of the phrase "surveillance capitalism." While <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> had a notion as to its
meaning, to speak publically with credibility demands knowledge and familiarity
of its wider use. And so <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am lead to the second work motivating this
action: Shoshana Zuboff's <strong>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</strong>. From the start,
she uncovers and succinctly elucidates what was to me simply a broad sense of
disatisfaction, defining and thoroughly analysing surveillance capitalism. She
raises a call to arms, offering her extensive research to inform us of what we
face. Be warned; it is a problem more serious than <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> suspected.</p>
<p>What excites me the most, however, are the nascent ideas emerging as <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> read
both these works: vulnerabilities and weak points of surveillance capitalism, as
well as the logic that will convince my peers to accept the challenge of taking
up arms. From Zuboff <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am alerted to a chink in the armor, a scale missing
from the dragon's underbelly, and from Cheng <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> garner the logical precision to
hit so small a target. Informed and inspired by these two works, the Tin Feather
evolves: from joke, to icon, and, with help and with hope, onwards to solution.
Fletched with Tin Feathers our loosed arrows will soon speed towards their
target.</p>

    <div>
<p>Choice of third-person pronoun is an issue of the modern world that simply did
not exist in my youth. Such issues are, however, to the aims of Tin Feathers. I
do feel the need to speak briefly of first-person pronouns.</p>
<p>"I" or "we"? Both are problematic. The first is egotistical and pretentious; the
second presumptious. Do I have a right to speak for all? Do I have a right to
speak <em>at all</em>? The only sensible conclusion is: I have the right to speak. You
have the right to ignore me.</p>
<p>More importantly, an "I" matters not to Tin Feathers. Bob Dylan captures an
important truth: "My name it means nothing." Ideas are universal; they belong to
us all. So the Zeitgeist speaks.</p>
<p>You may as fruitfully investigate the history and provenance of the air
molecules passing my vocal chords as consider me. The ideas presented here stand
in judgment on their own, independent of presentation and presenter. Significant
advantages will follow from this.</p>
<p>So perhaps a new pronoun is useful:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\iota\)</span></p>
<p><em>iota</em>: the ninth letter of the Greek alphabet. Also an English word which means
something inconsequential, "an infinitesimal amount" according to Mirriam-Webster.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> matter not one iota.</p>

<p>Yet precisely because I am no one I presume to speak to everyone.</p>
<p>Birth is trauma. Kicking and fighting we are brought into this world regardless
of our wishes. So it is with a social conscience. I did not want one. I do not
know what to do with it; how to nurture it. Life was decidedly easier before,
but such has fallen to me and I would be remiss not to give it voice. So the
Zeitgeist speaks.</p>
<p>The tin foil hat is a known symbol in our collective semiology. It captures the
suspicion, mistrust, and paranoia all in technology share regarding that with
which we forge our living. We know these tools all too well; we are their smiths.</p>
<p>Money, power, influence. Fake news, election tampering. Fortunes made and
fortunes lost. The rest of the world is slowly awakening to what we have long
been aware of, but hiding from. What we tried to laugh off with a tin hat joke.</p>
<p>I do not know how to fix this world. I know only that the first step is to
acknowledge the problem. That said, we need a forum for discussion, a common
store of information and raw data. We are problem solvers, after all. Can our
"many eyes" and the "wisdom of crowds" solve these problems? We shall see.</p>
<p>And so the Tin Feather. I wear the first in my hat to admit the problem and to
foster conversation. <strong>To protest surveillance capitalism and invasive data
harvesting.</strong> I lay before you not a gauntlet, but merely a feather. Now take it
up.</p>
<p>The tin feather... when a tin hat is too heavy.</p>
