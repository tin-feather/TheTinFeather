# Statement of Purpose

## Primary Purpose

The aim of the Tin Feather is
>__to protest surveillance capitalism and invasive data harvesting__,
>
admitting the existence of the problem and fostering discussion as to a solution.

To do so we propose to raise funding to create small jewelry pieces, such as a
lapel pin, brooch, earring, or necklace of a tin feather.

These will be distributed to backers and if possible, presented to well known
individuals and associations that we believe share this goal.

Initially this will done within the information technology community, with
aspirations of reaching a wider global community.

## Secondary Purpose

The secondary and ultimately more important aim is to provide the information
technology community proof of concept of a means to mobilze the talents, skills,
and energy that lie dormant and wasted within it in addressing the broader
difficult issues the world faces today.
