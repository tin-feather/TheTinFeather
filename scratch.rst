Okta:

- HR tie-in
- Customer list: DoJ
- keynotes: Barak Obama, Colin Powell
- "Improve M&A Agility" So are we all just supposed to be Okta ID'ed and the companies can shunt us about?

They are saying this all loud and clear. They are proud of it all! And there is
not a bad word being published about it.

Where the hell is Bruce Schneier?


Zero Trust indeed!
==================


zero trust? Full trust in the identity management service.
Trust as basis for a society. ~150 people


Choices
=======
|I| can choose not to join Facebook and "suffer" the consequences.

Can |I| choose to not have an income? Maybe |I| could have chosen that before
starting a family, getting a mortgage, etc. But the rules have been changed!
