# On Failure

How can Tin Feathers fail? many way. How can it succeed? Only one way.  In other
words, the odds are stacked against reformers.


So examine the modes of failure.

## failure to try
* head in sand
* need to discuss [programmer psyche]()
    * analysis paralysis

* mitigated by unassailable argument to act ?

##  failure to assemble
* lack of consensus

* mitigated by [minimal]() platform
* mitigated by simple definition of done


## failure to maintain unity

* mitigated by [minimal]() platform


## single points of failure

* ego failing due diligence
* command and control center
