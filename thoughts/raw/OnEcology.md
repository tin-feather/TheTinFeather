# Barry Commoner

[Barray Commoner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Commoner#Works)



1. Everything is connected to everything else. There is one ecosphere for all
living organisms and what affects one, affects all.
2. Everything must go somewhere. There is no "waste" in nature and there is no
"away" to which things can be thrown.
3. Nature knows best. Humankind has fashioned technology to improve upon nature,
but such change in a natural system is, says Commoner, "likely to be detrimental
to that system"
4. There is no such thing as a free lunch. Exploitation of nature will
inevitably involve the conversion of resources from useful to useless forms.



## Everything is connected

* tracking, cookies, etc etc
* lack of anonymity

## Everything goes somewhere
* big data


## Nature knows best
* Cavemen
* network of trust, Tribes
* Friendship, loyalty, human bonds

Not buttons and likes and subscribe.


## No free lunch
* If you're not paying for a product, you are the product.

* Also, the companies that are abusing us can only get away with it
for so long before protest spontaneously arises.
