# Sermons

Or rants... what is the difference? &iota; guess this is where we let the
emotions go a little bit.

Draw a feather on the back of your hand (palm?) and raise it high, not in a
fist, but opened. In defense. In welcome.


## Awakening

It may serve to awaken a social conscience in others.

Here in lies the true potential of Tin Feathers.

Programmers, coders, software engineers. We go by many names, likely due to the
modernity of our industry. And we do tend to share certain social traits and
characteristics which conspire to prevent us achieving what we should in the
larger circles of the world.

I am not talking about our incessant moaning about our collective mistreatment
in the larger industrial setting. I am refering to the secret fear we all hold
of others profiting more than ourselves from the fruits of our labor. I am
speaking more towards the analysis paralysis and impostor syndrome that holds us
back professionally and socially in and out of the office.

But let's face it. We are not as bad as some. The old joke is about
mathematicians, not programmers. (How can spot the extrovert at a maethematical
conference?  Look for the one staring at the other person's shoes.)

There is alot of "Big Ego" in our population. And we certainly exhibit more
hubris than other industries. But we count a lot of smart people in our numbers,
too. I have seen them. I haev tried to drive them out of the woodwork.

Imagine with me for a monent, indulge this flight of fancy, if you will and
consider what we might accomplish properly channelled.
<rant>
It sickens and frankly embarrasses me that with some of the most intelligent
people on this planet working in it, our industries greatest riches are
accumulated through advertisement. Advertisement. The same as for television.
The same as for radio. The same as for print media. WTF?!
</rant>

I have come to believe that it is the combination of those traits so strongly
corellated with success in our field that inhibits the application of our
energies and talents to the more serious problems this wold faces.

The greatest accomplishment Tin Feathers could have would be to demonstrate how
to effectively harness the collective power that lies misaligned within us. The
power of a magnet arise from alignment of microscopic dipoles.



Yes, it is addressed only to developers for now.




## Problems in world today
----------------
first world problems
Surveillance capitalism and invasive data harvesting + EVERYTHING ELSE


## HUBRIS!
so much to emphasize here


## Orthogonality

Some people love furry little animals and have them as pets.
Other people _eat_ furry little animals.
Other people dress up as furry little animals.
And you know what? __It doesn't matter.__
---------------
Separation of concern.

## Purity of Purpose

If anyone tries to use the Tin Feather to try to sell you something,
or get you to subscribe to something, or like something then
they have missed th point.



## Power of Decoupling

Ask the grumpy old git in the corner cubicle who doesn';t use an IDE. Or if your
company is lucky enough to have 2 of them, the ones who aregue vi versus emacs.
The ones who, whether or no they admit it, answer more questions on Stack
Overflow than they ask. They know these things. They have seen them far too many
times, over and over again.

We are ripe for exploitation. Our power of narrow focus lets us analyses and
crack problems others can not, byut it blindds us to the larger context in which
our solutations are deployed.


## Nothing You DOn't Already Know

&iota; am not saying anythiong new. &iota; am not saying anything _at all!_

Life of Brian: "You are all individuals."


Some people love furry little animals and have them as pets.
Other people _eat_ furry little animals.
Other people dress up as furry little animals.
And you know what? __It doesn't matter.__


## Ad Oculos
from [link](https://glosbe.com/la/en/ad%20oculos)
```
to the eyes
Meaning "obvious on sight" or "obvious to anyone that sees it".
```
Obvious to anyone that sees it. What blindness aflicts us that so many do not
see that which is before them?
