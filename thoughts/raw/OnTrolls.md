# On Trolls and Peer Review

The [scientific method](OnScientificMethod) has replicability as a key element.
An experiment must be repeatable by others than the original scientist by
following instructions documented and shared. This ensures both the veracity of
the result and the sufficiency of the description as reported. It makes sure
that nothing has been left out; all variables accounted for.

In ithe modern era this has captured by a process of peer review. 
In the last few years it has given rise to a crisis of repeatbility, in fact, as
a significant number of reported results have turned out to be unrepeatable.

In our field of software development the process of peer review is fulfilled by
the sometimes brutal process of code review. Revealing aspects of the
[programmer psyche](OnProgrammerPsyche.md) we might prefer not to admit, the at
times brutal nature of this process has been widely recorded.
