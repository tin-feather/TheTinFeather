Perhaps Plato was right; we can not teach. We can only remind one on what is
already kown. (Socrates and the slave)

That means there is an awful lot &iota; have forgotten. &iota have forgotten
more about just about anything you care to name than any other man or woman on
earth knows.

Simplicity of message.

The lesson, once learned, is independent of the reminder.
