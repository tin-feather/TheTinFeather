# On Naïveté

Surveillance capitalism depends on what SHoshan Zuboff call "surveillance
assets."

Companies today are creating enormous databases of extensive personal
information. What governemnt is going to be able to resist the lure of such
data? What criminal? It is as if we everyone suddenly decided to take all their
valuables from their houses and place them in a common pile in the town square.
Is there any security? Maybe a few cops with truncheons.

This is an irresistable invitation to governments and hackers.

Legislators act as if they believe governments will abide by the guidelines they
set.


# The Myth of the Secure Database

People, both within the information technology industry and without, believe in
secure databases. That is an oxymoron. Think of it this way. You have a birthday.
That is a fact. If I record that birthday along with your name on a piece of
paper, in a computer, or even in my own memory that fact has become data. What
is the difference? Data can be recalled. Data can be found.

A _data_base holds data: facts to be recalled. If the data can be recalled it is
not secure. If it can be recalled than your fact is vulnerable to either a
technological attack or a social attack. A database can be accessed. If it can't
be accessed then it __isn't a database__.

Logically and definitionally there simply is no such thing as a secure database!

# The Myth of the Restrained Security Organization
# The Myth of the Poltical Solution to Government Surveillance
They call them _secret_ services for a reason. These organizations are not
in the business of reporting their every technique.

&iota; am not arguing whether they are a good thing or a bad thing. &iota; am
not arguing whether they should exist or not. &iota; am only pointing out that
if they exist, then logically, they will not respect bounds on their behavior
set by law makers.


After a modicum of logical analysis these truths are self-evident.
