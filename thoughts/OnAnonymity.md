# On Anonymity

&iota; write anonymously soley because these ideas deserve presentation
unburdened by personal ego.

&iota; am under no illusions that this exercise is as yet important enough to
warrant even the _attention_ of the infamous "powers that be."

In today's world, both digital and physical, it is trivially easy to associate
a walking breathing human being to these words. To save you even that small
trouble &iota; point you to the public email address associated with this
account.
