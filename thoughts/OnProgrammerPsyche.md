# On Programmer Psyche

Introspection is a powerful feature of many of the progamming languages we use.
We need to apply it to ourselves.

## Negatives

### Fear
* fear of explotation.

We know we are exploited. Our biggest fear is to be the developer of the next
QDOS. yet we know, too, that we are priviledged and have no right to complain.


We are aware of the difficulties of an ill-defined problem. We do not like
getting things wrong. These traits keep us from acting.


### addicition to immediate reward
* the satisfaction of the immediate solution
* hides the longer term damage
* focus on immediate/local causes us to ignore the longer term / global

### Anxiety
* impostor syndrome
* guilt


### Hubris
Too much in some and the mistakes they make keeps others from acting out of fear
of making same mistakes. Even when those others may actually be better able to
solve the problem.

## Positives

### Precision
* logic
* organization

## Experience
dealing with problems of exactly the sort the world now faces
* large
* ill-defined
* dynamic


using techniques to solve such problems
* divide and conquer
* composition
* agile?



## Both
### Focus
Intense focus lets us solve the immediate problem but hides the longer term,
broader context from us. Sometimes we do not see the damage we are doing.
