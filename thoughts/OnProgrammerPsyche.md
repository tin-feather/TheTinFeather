# On Programmer Psyche

Introspection is a powerful feature of many of the progamming languages we use.
We need to apply it to ourselves. There are characteristics shared throughout
our population in greater numbers than the world as a whole. We
disproportionaely represent

Sterotype and prejudices aside we need to self examine and learn in order to
over come the problems these issues engender. &iota; risk falling into the
error of the sweeping generalization here more so than in the rest of this work.
For defense I offer merely that most of this comes from examining myself and
reflecting upon those traits that I see echoed throughout my community.

## Negatives

There is a reason fear, uncertainty, and doubt have been used to such powerful
and distructuve effect within the information technology community. Those three
emotions underlie the darkest depths of our psyche.

### Fear
* fear of explotation

We know we are exploited. Our biggest fear is to be the developer of the next
QDOS. yet we know, too, that we are priviledged and have no right to complain.

* fear of exposure
Impostor syndrome is a rampant amongst us. Perhaps it is over compensation that
leads to the opposite evil of hubris in our ranks.


We do not like getting things wrong.

### Uncertinty
We are aware of the difficulties of an ill-defined problem. We know that, though
the customer is always right, the customer hasn;t a clue what they want. This
leads to the shifting sands of requirements and feature requests.



### Doubt
* Anxiety
* impostor syndrome
* guilt


These traits keep us from acting.



### addicition to immediate reward
* the satisfaction of the immediate solution
* hides the longer term damage
* focus on immediate/local causes us to ignore the longer term / global

This leads to the very addiction that permits the continued existence of the
surveillance industry. The rush of the like, the up-vote, the gold, the positive
feedback. It is perhaps our natural insecurity that makes us so veulnerable to
the lure of such feedback.


### Hubris
Too much in some and the mistakes they make keeps others from acting out of fear
of making same mistakes. Even when those others may actually be better able to
solve the problem.


## Charisma
Are we more prone to fall for the charismatic leader than other sub-populations?
&iota; do not know. It would make a certain sense. A life colored by the poor
social skills we typically have may leave us more prone to the spell of the
charismatic leader. There is a noticeable cultism that runs through us.



## Positives

### Precision
* logic
* organization
* relentless - &iota; joke that &iota; have callouses on my forehead from the
number of brick walls &iota; have banged upon until they crumbled.

## Experience
dealing with problems of exactly the sort the world now faces
* large
* ill-defined
* dynamic


using techniques to solve such problems
* divide and conquer
* composition
* agile?



## Both
### Focus
Intense focus lets us solve the immediate problem but hides the longer term,
broader context from us. Sometimes we do not see the damage we are doing.
