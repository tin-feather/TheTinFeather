# On Consensus

As individuals we are limited. Aligned, our collective efforts can accumulate to
great effect. To work as one, however, requires agreement on certain
fundamentals; we must hold a clear and common goal.


This is harder to achieve than it sounds. A long time ago a thinker named Euclid
wrote down five ideas upon which to base all of geometry. Five axioms so basic
and obvious as to be incontestable. These postulates were to serve as foundation
of the pooled effort of generations of mathematicians to follow. To his credit,
he scored 4 out of 5. The last, however, took two millenia to resolve.


Heeding that lesson, the challenge here is to define a concise and simple goal
-- a measurable "definition of done" -- upon which we can all not only agree,
but believe in sufficiently to motivate action.


If a social movemnt sets out to right all the wrongs in the world it will have
such a long list of positions, tasks, and goals that it will never be able to
maintain the unity of purpose necessary to achieve any of them.
