# On Intellectual Property


As programmers we work with ideas. We share this with authors and philosophers
and scientists. Matters of intellectual property are important to us and in factr
underlie some of our most primal professional fears.


Yet this is a public reposittory. Am &iota; not afraid that someone will _steal_
these words and profit from them?

These ideas are not _owned_ by anyone. As they pass thropugh me &iota; struggle
to capture them, to give them voice, so that they may spread to the benefit of
all.
