# On Timing

## Why now?

The world is facing pressure to solve an increasd number of problems in a
decreasing amount of time.


More problems + less time to solve them -> increased pressure

## Existential threats
If a sabre-toothed tiger eats a caveman that is bad news for him and his genetic
legacy, born or unborn. Planetary scale mass extinctions must be considered a
more serious problem.
