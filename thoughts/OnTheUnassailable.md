# On the unassailable

An unassailable argument: the holy grail of disputants since before logic was
invented. A case so right, so flawless that no objection can be raised.


You might think that the simplest way to create such a case would be to say
nothing at all. An empty case. The null hypothesis. Yet even such a strategy
fails. To say nothing when something needs to be said is wrong. So what _needs_
to be said? Suddenly we are arguing again. So much for that unassailable
argument.


But we can learn lessons here from mathematics. Eugenia Cheng correctly points
out the differences between precision and pedantry, as she puts it. We need to
be precise in what we claim. We need to precise in our goals.



## Separation of Concern

Last centruy, the developers of the Unix operating system were aware of this and
followed the [design principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
of many small components interacting to achieve great effect. &iota; do not
believe it is a coincidence that many of the founders have degress in
mathematics.


```
Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
```

=======================

If I tell you something you already know and I do not ask you for anything then
how can you disgree?
