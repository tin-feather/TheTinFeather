# On Distribution

How can we gather support and funding anonymously? Record no email address.
Have no record. To prove that we are not guilty of that which we protest.

Have to distribute Tin Feathers publically and freely. Let people lift them
themselves. Or get people to give them away. Where? 
* Unix conferences
* other conferences, etc
This is just indirect... not recording the last mile. so sto speak
