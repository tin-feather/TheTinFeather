# On Minimalism

The more planks in our manifesto, the smaller will be the population that
supports them all. Logical "and" conjunctive.  To negate takes only a single
item.


Eugenia Cheng has tackled the harder problem of addressing a wider audience.
&iota; am only aiming for programmers. Can &iota; assume knowledge of DeMorgan's
Law?


Imagine &iota; am opening a night club. To keep it private &iota; enforce strict
entry criteria. Black tie required for entry. Shoes not sneakers. The longer the
list of requirements the more likely a potential customer  falls foul of one of
them and the fewer people will be in the club. So much for that business idea.


If, on the other hand, &iota; have a minimal list of requiremnts: say, only that
all who enter must be able to stand on their own two feet (to preclude the
paralytically drunk) then there will be a lot more people in the club every
night. (Even this seemingly resoanable requirement, however, strictly enforced
would exclude wheel-chair bound patrons reducing club profits.)


In terms of logic, this is simply DeMorgan's Law. The negation of a series of
predicatates combined with the "and" conjunction is the negation of each
connected by "or". Each additional term combined with an "and" restrively
filters the possiblilties, reducing uthe population that satisfies the compound
condition. As programmers we regularly see this in our code.


To ensure a large poplulation, the defining characteristics must be kept to a
minimum.
