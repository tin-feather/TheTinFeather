# On Licensing

Could a visible Tin Feather imply a license obligation on the owner of the
surveillance camera which records it?

Think of the Eifel Tower at night or 35 Hudson Yard stair-case thing.

Wearing it would have a real, legal meaning as opposed to just a signifier.

This would be a real coup!
