There is something in human nature that drives us to understand. What child has
not taken something apart out of curiosity? In onder of how it works, of what
makes it tick. Still as an adult &iota; feel that urge and have wondered at the
sophisticated engineering &iota; have discvoered designed into some seemingly
simple childrens' toys.


Disassembly and dissection can increase understanding, but they are destructive
techniques and detroy utility. Perhaps there are people in this world who have
been able to put back together everything they have ever disassembled. Alas,
&iota; can not count myself amongst their number.
