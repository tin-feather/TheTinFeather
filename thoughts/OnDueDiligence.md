# On Due Diligence

Due diligence is important. In simple terms it can be explained by the maxim
"Look before you leap." However, it can also be a trap that prevents action when
action is needed.

As cautious, skeptical people good programmers like to investigate problems
before proposing solutions. I suppose there are prgrammers that will immediately
implement the first idea that comes into their head, but to be brutally honest,
they are more part of the problem than part of the solution.


A good programmer spends a lot of time pondering.

This, incidentally, causes lots of confusion and frustration in the industry.
The expert in the corner may appear to be doing nothing for days on end before
she checks in a few lines of code, while others are hammering away at their
keyboards. Those few lines of code, however, will likely stand the test of time.


But &iota; digress...


The skeptical nature of a mature programmer causes them to reserve commitment to
a socail cause as much as a new technology.

"First, do no harm." &iota; stated that as a code of conduct for this exercise.
A dilemma arise when inactivity itself becomes a casue of harm.
