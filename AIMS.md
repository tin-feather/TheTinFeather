# Aims and Aspirations

My naïveté embrrases me, but someone has to step forward with a proposition.


## 0. Organization and mobilization
Please see the [contrib](https://github.com/tin-feather/TheTinFeather/blob/master/CONTRIB.md) page.

## 1. Education and raising awareness

I see understated jewelry that is simple yet curious enough to generate a question,
start a converstation:
> "What is that pin? A feather? What does that mean?"

My own was crafted and gifted me by my daughter, but that does not scale. Is a
Kickstarter campaign appropriate? Raise funds to manufacture 10,000 lapel pins?

## 2. Long term
* Button hole 'celebrity' endorsements. How do we reach Linus Torvalds, Tim Berners-Lee, Chuck Palahniuk?
* Cooperate with the EFF. will deal with us?
* Contribute funding to Max Schrems, others.
* On-going reporting or corporate maleficence



## Merchandise
To help financially support the exercise.

Beyond the lapel pins there are ear rings, neck laces.
Traditional "merch"

We could have little bit of fun here, too with bespoke tin-foil hats and a few other ideas
that have already been contributed.
